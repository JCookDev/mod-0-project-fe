## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?  

   I feel great about asking questions because it gives me an opportunity to learn and gain more clarity about about what I'm learning.  
   Because I'm eager to learn, I feel that I tend to ask questions too soon at times.  
   But I'm also a great listener, so I usually like to hear or read instructions before asking my questions.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.  

   The **Number** data type, which is used in JS to handle all numbers, including negative and floating-point numbers.  

   The **String** data type, which is used in JS to handle any kind of text.  

   The **Boolean** data type, which is used in JS to evaluate whether a value is *true* or *false*.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?  

   I would use the code below:  

```javascript
var greeting = "Hello World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?  

   The character(s) I would use to indicate comments in a JS file are `//` and `/* */`.  

   Code comments are used to communicate to other developers about what my code is doing.  
   Another purpose of code commenting is to temporarily deactivate blocks of code to keep them from running.  

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?  

   A *variable* is used in JS to represent and store some sort of value.  

   A variable is like a box, which can be used to store valuable things that you may want to use later.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?  

   Most sites that I visit usually ask for **Username**, **Email** and **Password**.  
   So the variables are probably `userName`, `userEmail` and `userPassword`.  
   I believe each of those variables would hold the *string* data type.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.  

   *Concatenation* is the process of combining multiple values together.


8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?  

   I think many sites use *Concatenation* to combine my user-name with their greeting message.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)  

   I'm sure I can (and I will) google this. But I'm wondering, how are programming languages like JS created?
