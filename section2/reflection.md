## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?  

   Two points from the Growth Mindset exercise resonated with me:  
    * The importance of being comfortable with seeking out and taking on challenges.  

    * Mistakes are essential to learning.


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?  

   ### My Current Growth Mindset  

      * I'm comfortable with challenging myself to learn and grow.
      * I love learning from my mistakes and the mistakes of others.
      * I believe I can improve my coding skills with effort and practice.
      * I'm not afraid to ask for help.  

  ### Ways I Can Improve My Growth Mindset

      * I can ask for help sooner.
      * I can improve in the area of setting **S.M.A.R.T** goals.
      * I can be more patient with myself when going through learning processes.
      * I can improve upon the process of reflecting on my coding process.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?  

   Not having the same support of detailed instructions, helped to reinforce the practices that are
    taught in the growth mindset lesson. The act of repetition allowed me to remember how and when  
    to run my files in node. Also, the vague instructions gave me the opportunity to use what I've
    learned thus far to complete each task. Overall, Section 2 did challenge me and I felt proud
    that I realized the opportunity to tap in to my growth mindset while outside of my comfort-zone.


4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

   The conditional statements in JS are **if, else, else if and switch-case statements**.  
   They are used for checking a specific condition and executing the code based on the specified condition.  

   **Daily Life Example:**   
   If I chose to write with a pencil, I can erase my work if I make a mistake.  
   If I chose to write with a pen, I can't erase my work if I make a mistake.  

   **Web-app Example:**
   On BeatStars, users can listen to beats made by indie producers. A simple example of where a conditional statement may be used is when a user clicks on a beat's mp3 player. It may say something like: "If user clicks the play button, change the play icon to the pause icon ".

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.  

   You add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by combining it with `else` and `else if` statements.
   The program will check each condition and run each specified task based on the rules that are defined by the developer.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?  

  I can use the logical-and operator (`&&`), to check that that both conditions are met.
  I can use the logical-or operator (`||`) to check that one of 2 conditions are met.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?  
   Why is it not recommended to use an `if` statement with an assignment like "`x=y`" as a condition?
