## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?  

   It felt great, because I was able to connect the dots about what the code was actually
   doing.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.  

   I play Spades Plus often, I can see the developers using arrays to store
   decks of cards.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.  

   An array method is a way to access and or update values of an array.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?  

   The purpose of loops, are to help developers write code in their programs that
    will run repetitive tasks. A loop would be used in conjunction with an array
    when you want to run the same code for each array item. A loop wouldn't be used
    with an array, if you were running a calculation on one variable .

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?  

   Loop are used to tell your computer program to run the same task for a set  
   number of times.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?  

   While doing some digging through the MDN docs, I ran across the `forEach()` method.  
   In terms of using a for-loop to multiply each item in an array of numbers. Is this method a more efficient way to produce the results?
